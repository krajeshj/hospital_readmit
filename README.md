Statistical Inference 3 Springboard

A. Initial observations based on the plot above
Overall, rate of readmissions is trending down with increasing number of discharges
With lower number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of excess rate of readmissions (area shaded red)
With higher number of discharges, there is a greater incidence of lower rates of readmissions (area shaded green)

B. Statistics
In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges < 100, mean excess readmission rate is 1.023 and 63% have excess readmission rate greater than 1
In hospitals/facilities with number of discharges > 1000, mean excess readmission rate is 0.978 and 44% have excess readmission rate greater than 1

C. Conclusions
There is a significant correlation between hospital capacity (number of discharges) and readmission rates.
Smaller hospitals/facilities may be lacking necessary resources to ensure quality care and prevent complications that lead to readmissions.

D. Regulatory policy recommendations
Hospitals/facilties with small capacity (< 300) should be required to demonstrate upgraded resource allocation for quality care to continue operation.
Directives and incentives should be provided for consolidation of hospitals and facilities to have a smaller number of them with higher capacity and number of discharges.

# Exercise
Preliminary report was read, Null and Alternate Hpothesis was set up, observations for hospitals with < 100 Dicharges and hospitals with > 1000 discharges were grouped, A t-test and joint plot was used to ome up with conclusions
